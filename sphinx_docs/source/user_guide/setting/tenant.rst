Tenant Management
====================

Loonflow supports multi-tenant. Most users only need a single tenant; if you require multi-tenant capabilities, please contact blackholll (blackholll@163.com; blackholll_cn@gmail.com) for licensing. In multi-tenant mode all data—users, tickets, workflows, notifications, applications, roles, departments, and more—are fully isolated. Typical scenarios include group enterprises or SaaS deployments where multiple independent organizations share one platform.

Future roadmap
--------------
Planned: cross-tenant ticket collaboration, allowing tickets to flow between tenants. Example scenarios: inter-company ticket handling, external customer cases, supplier tickets, and reseller/partner support.
