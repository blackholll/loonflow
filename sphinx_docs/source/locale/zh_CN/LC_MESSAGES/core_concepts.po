"Sub-tickets are primarily used when ticket flow involves hierarchical "

"two levels: project cycle and application cycle. When a project is in "
"development, multiple related applications may be at different stages "
"(code writing, static scanning, unit testing, development completion, "
"etc.). When all application nodes complete development, the project node "
"transitions to testing. In this scenario, application tickets are sub-"
"tickets of the project ticket, and the parent node of application tickets"
" is the project's \"In Development\" node."
