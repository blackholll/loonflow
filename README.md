# 🚀 Loonflow 3.0 - A Fresh Start

Loonflow is an open-source process automation platform developed based on Django. After multiple versions of iteration and refactoring, we proudly present Loonflow 3.0 - a version that achieves a qualitative leap in visualization, flexibility, and scalability.

The core of version 3.0 is "making complex business processes simple and visual, making personalized customization needs within reach." Not only have we rebuilt the process and form designers, but we have also constructed a powerful extension framework, aiming to become the most core process engine in enterprise digital transformation.
